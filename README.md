# oxymon
for the best authentication so far

factors that affects on this written script have been null on this end 

but areas to considered looking at also is when users are given the prompt call to send documents file or images
it's good in the company interest to restrict and hash script every document file and image file sent on the companies database
else an individuals might placed a file as send.jsx.php and get prompt decision on malware function depending on the script in that
file having access to see all folders and can cause serious harm to the company

well there much more consideration but i will make a pulse here at the moment.


Thanks for this opportunity oxymon. look forward for a better working environment with you all
